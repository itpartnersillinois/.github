# Code review

We review code to put another set of eyes on code that is going to production. More people that look at code means that you get different views on how to do things. It also serves as a form of cross-training and collaboration that allows us to share techniques. 

## Skipping Code Reviews

There will be cases when you cannot review code (either everyone else is out or busy), or times when code reviews are impractical. If you need to skip code review, please contact the manager of your department and get permission first (Jeremy for College of Education; Chris, Meagan, or Aaron for Gies College of Business).
