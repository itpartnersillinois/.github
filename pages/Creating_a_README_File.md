# Creating a README.md File

A README.md file helps other developers work on your application. Please use the template below:


     # IT Partners Readme.md file

     ## Summary: 

     ## Production location / dependencies: 

     ## Development location / dependencies: 

     ## How to deploy to production/development: 

     ## How to set up locally: 

     ## How to test (including unit tests): 

     ## Notes (error logging, external tools, links, etc.):

Note that "How to deploy to production/development" should include what branches are used to edit and what the process is to promote pages. Some sample language:
* Maintainers commit directly to main.
* Does not require code review
* Contains .NET Framework and .NET Core versions
