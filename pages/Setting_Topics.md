# Setting Topics (required)

At the main repository page, choose the gear icon. You will see the following pop-up screen:

![Edit Repository Details Screen](https://github.com/itpartnersillinois/tutorial/blob/master/images/edit_repository_details_screen.png)

This allows you to edit the "about" and add topics. You should add topics to your repository to allow other team members to find your projects. Some suggested topics:
* web
* data
* configuration
* component (for sharable .NET components)
* function-app
* logic-app
* classroom-tools
* static-site
* proof-of-concept

You do not need to put the language the program is in. 

You may include the NetId of the primary developer(s) on the project as a topic. This allows someone to see all projects a developer is responsible for.
