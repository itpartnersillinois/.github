# Code Reviews

We review code to put another set of eyes on code that is going to production. More people that look at code means that you get different views on how to do things. It also serves as a form of cross-training and collaboration that allows us to share techniques. 

You can see [an outstanding list of code reviews](https://github.com/pulls?user=itpartnersillinois).

## Calling Out Code Reviews

You can post to Microsoft Teams to request code reviews. However, feel free to call out individual people if you want someone specific to look at the code. When modifying code that someone else usually maintains, you should specifically request a code review from that person and, if possible, wait until that person has reviewed the code before continuing with the merge request. 

## How to handle comments

If someone has added a comment, it should be marked as resolved before continuing with the merge request. If it cannot be handled immediately, you should mark it as an issue before continuing with the merge.

## Skipping Code Reviews

There will be cases when you cannot review code (either everyone else is out or busy), or times when code reviews are impractical. If you need to skip code review, please post in the [ITP Developers - Code Review and Conversation channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/_?tenantId=44467e6f-462c-4ea2-823f-7800de5434e3#/school/conversations/ITP%20Developers%20-%20Code%20Review%20and%20Conversation?groupId=e7f43315-5065-401c-b665-e24eebc69e8d&threadId=19:70374f7fb97a46e3ae247fd825b20d6a@thread.skype&ctx=channel). 

All pulls are sent to the ITP Automated Channels and Github team, under the [Github Pull Requests](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3A4faa6dc17ec4444589563fc5466ae5ce%40thread.tacv2/Github%20Pull%20Requests%20(EG)?groupId=45254593-9c0a-4df4-8908-ff3eda8597dd&tenantId=).
