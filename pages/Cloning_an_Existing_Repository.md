# Cloning an Existing Repository

The easiest way to clone an existing repository is to open a terminal window. 

Go to your local repository and type 

     git clone *url of repository*

Example:

     git clone https://github.com/itpartnersillinois/tutorial.git

When you run git clone, the following actions occur:
* A new folder called repo is made
* It is initialized as a Git repository
* A remote named origin is created, pointing to the URL you cloned from
* All of the repository's files and commits are downloaded there
* The default branch is checked out
