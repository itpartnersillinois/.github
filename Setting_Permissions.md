# Setting Permissions 

If you choose an "Internal" repository, then everyone who is part of the IT Partners Organization will have access to write to the repository. You shouldn't need to change the permissions set. 

If you need to manually add or change permissions, go to Settings --> Manage Access. You will see the following screen:

This has the repository type ("Internal Repository"), what security the IT Partners Organization has ("Write"), and who outside the team has access ("Direct Access"). You can invite new people to the repository or elevate existing members by clicking on the green "Invite Teams or People" button.
