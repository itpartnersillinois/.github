Naming is tough. If you have a solution name, you'll want the repository to be the same name as the solution. The solution should also be the same name as the main project or deployed item, so you'll have a lot of things that are named the same. This is a feature, not a bug. 

The description is not important, but it is nice to give a one-sentence summary of the project. Most of the information in the description will be repeated in the tags and the README.md file, so it is OK to be vague. 

Under most circumstances, you'll be choosing an "Internal" repository. This will ensure that other members of the team can write to your project. Choose "Private" for test projects you don't want others to see. You should not choose "Public." 

Do not initialize with a README.md or .gitignore.
