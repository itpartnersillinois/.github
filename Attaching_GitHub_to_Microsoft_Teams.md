# Attaching GitHub to Microsoft Teams

When you check in a branch into any project within the IT Partners organization, it will automatically write a message to the Gitlab Check In Channel in the Information Technology Partners team. You do not need to make any changes to your repository to include this. 

This allows everyone a single place to see what people are working on in terms of pulls and merges across the organization.
