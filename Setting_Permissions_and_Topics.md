# Setting Permissions and Topics

## Setting Permissions (optional)

If you choose an "Internal" repository, then everyone who is part of the IT Partners Organization will have access to write to the repository. You shouldn't need to change the permissions set. 

If you need to manually add or change permissions, go to Settings --> Manage Access. You will see the repository type ("Internal Repository"), what security the IT Partners Organization has ("Write"), and who outside the team has access ("Direct Access"). You can invite new people to the repository or elevate existing members by clicking on the green "Invite Teams or People" button. 

## Setting Topics (required)

At the main page, choose the gear icon.

This allows you to edit the "about" and add topics. You should add topics to your repository to allow other team members to find your projects. Some suggested topics:
* web
* data
* configuration
* component (for sharable .NET components)
* function-app
* logic-app
* classroom-tools
* static-site
* proof-of-concept

You do not need to put the language the program is in.
